# puts fname + " " + lname

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# fname = gets.chomp

# puts "Please enter your last name"
# lname = gets.chomp

# puts "Your name is #{fname + " " + lname}"

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).
# puts "Please enter your first color"
# color1 = gets.chomp

# puts "Please enter your second color"
# color2 = gets.chomp

# puts "Please enter your third color"
# color3 = gets.chomp

# if name != "Santa"
#   puts "You're not Santa."
# else
#   puts "Hello Santa!"

# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).
# puts "What is the name of the book?"
# title = gets.chomp

# puts "What is the name of the author?"
# author = gets.chomp

# puts "The title and author is " + title + " by " + author

# puts "Please enter the first city."
# city1 = gets.chomp
